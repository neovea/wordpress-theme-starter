 * * DO NOT WRITE DIRECTLY IN THIS FILE ! *
 * It's purpose is to call a unique css file, main.css, which makes all the imports
 *
 * If you need to had your own styles, you'd better prefer using the given child theme, or create your own SASS based stylesheet,
 * then import it in sass/mail.scss, the compile it with COMPASS. But I recommend using a child theme to avoid any
 * data loose when updating the theme to an earlier version.
 *
 * For any question, ask it on the main theme page on WordPress.org or GitHub.

 * Cheers !
